# earthquakes-grades-graphs

## Description
The code is able to accumulate data from a foreign file and graph its data after converting the data into clusters. I built this project to help develop my skills on dictionary usage through functions, file access, and graphing.

## Features
The project features 5 main functions. The first function loads the data in from a foreign file and puts it intoa dictionary. The second function computes the Eucledian distance between the points formed from the data. The third function creates centroids for the clusters that will be on the graph based on the data. The fourth data uses the centroids to create clusters which will eventually be used on the graph. The final function displays the final graph with the clusters. The program specializes in dictionary usage, graphing, and file interaction.

## How to Use
In order to use the code, download the code through a zip file and open the zip file up. Next, upload the file components to your local compiler.

## Technologies 
The system used to create this app was a MacBook Pro. The MacBook Pro has an 8-Core Intel Core i9 processor and 16 GB of memory.

## Collaborators
I was able to develop this code through the guidance of the University of Oregon Computer Science and Information division.
